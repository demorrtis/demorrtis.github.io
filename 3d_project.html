<p>For this 3d project, I created an imaginary setting based off of real ancient pyramids 
<br> 
inspired by the pyramids from the animated film <i> The Road to El Dorado </i>. 
<br>

I used an already existing 3D model for the pyramid and modified them to have hold similar details as those in the movie. 
<br>  
A body of water and small buildings on the side of the water were part of the setting. Bc of the symmetry these
<br> 
structures held, it made it possible to easily build them up. Printing this model didn't come out 
<br> 
as perfectly planned, but there were ways around to be able to fix it - such as creating a separete
<br> 
model of the smaller buildings on the side to later add to the larger printed base.   </p>
