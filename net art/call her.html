<P class="storytext" > You try calling her this time. You feel like you should have called earlier, how stupid. 
	<br>
	As the phone rings, you look around in case you see her walking down at any moment. But she doesn't. 
	<br> 
	<br>
	You wait a little longer before you hear shuffling on the other end of the call. <i> Haley picked up </i> 
	<br> " Hey, now's not the best time " she says. You hear alarms going off through the call, " Oh, don't worry about me, 
just take care of yourself out there alright? " Before you could reply to her, the call was cut off. You dont know what this meant but 
the end of the call left you with a sick feeling in your stomach.
<br>
As you put your phone away you feel someone grab your shoulder on your shoulder. You turn to find your friend who called you earlier, he seems out of breath. 
		"I got here as fast as I could!" You let him calm down before he could speak again.

		" I don't know if you remember but I - I can send you back if you're willing," Your memory's a blur. 
		You might have remembered something like this. "<i> I </i> can't go back, but I can send <i> you </i> back. 
		Only thing is that if I end you back, you'll feel a little more exhausted and drained than before." Part of you wants to find a way 
to save Haley, but this other part of you feels like you can't do it.
