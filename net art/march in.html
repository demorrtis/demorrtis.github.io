<P class=storytext > You're probably not supposed to be in here, but you walk right in. 
You look for her office, but you can't seem to find her. Most of the desk spaces are empty as it seems like they all left for the day. 
You might have just missed her. There's a commotion in the main lobby when you head back. 
Everyone has their eyes glued onto the TV in the room.

	It's breaking news and there's a fire. It's the appartments where Haley lives. 
	You watch as you see clips of firefighters doing their work and putting out the fire. 
	There's doesn't seem to be much left. <br> 
	<br>
	<br>
	 As you turn to head away from the screen, you feel someone grab your shoulder. It's your friend who called you earlier, he seems out of breath. 
		"I got here as fast as I could!" You let him calm down before he could speak again.

		" I don't know if you remember but I - I can send you back if you're willing," Your memory's a blur. 
		You might have remembered something like this. "<i> I </i> can't go back, but I can send <i> you </i> back. 
		Only thing is that if I end you back, you'll feel a little more exhausted and drained than before." Part of you wants to find a way 
to save Haley, but this other part of you feels like you can't do it.
