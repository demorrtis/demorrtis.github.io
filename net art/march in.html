<P class=storytext > You look for her office, but you can't seem to find her. Most of the desk spaces re empty as it seems like they all left for the day. You might have just missed her. There's a commotion in the main lobby when you head back. Everyone has their eyes glued onto the TV in the room.

It's breaking news and there's a fire. It's the appartments where Haley lives. You watch as you see clips of firefighters doing their work and putting out the fire. There's doesn't seem to be much left.
