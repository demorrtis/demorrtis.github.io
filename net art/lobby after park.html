<P class=storytext > You make your way to haley's work place only to find a crowd gathered around the TV.
 You take a closer look at what theyre watching and find that it's breaking news. There is a fire right in Haleys appartment. 
 
 <br> 
 <br>  
As you turn to head away from the screen, you feel someone grab your shoulder. It's your friend who called you earlier, he seems out of breath.<br>
	<img src="images/lys n ty.jpg" width="800"  alt=""/> 
	<br>
		"I got here as fast as I could!" You let him calm down before he could speak again. 
		<br> 
		" I don't know if you remember but I - I can send you back if you're willing," Your memory's a blur. 
		You might have remembered something like this. "<i> I </i> can't go back, but I can send <i> you </i> back. 
		Only thing is that if I end you back, you'll feel a little more exhausted and drained than before." Part of you wants to find a way 
to save Haley, but this other part of you feels like you can't do it.
