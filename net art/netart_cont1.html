<P class=storytext > You answer your phone with a groggy "Hello?" when suddenly you hear your friend, Lysander, through the phone, " Haley's in trouble, you need to get to her quick! "
	<br> You just saw her earlier today, how could that be? 
	You get ready as quickly as you could - throwing on your coat, scarf, and shoes as you stumble down the stairs of your apartment heading out to the cold streets looking for your friend. </P>
