	<P class=storytext > You head over to the people taking care of the fire. From what you see, the building isn't going to make it. What caused this? 
		<br>
		It takes you a while to get the attention of some of the firefighters. They just tell you to step back and head to safety. 
		<br> 
		<br>
		You assume the worst now that Haley is nowhere in sight. You retreat from the scene. You can't be around it anymore. 
		As you're walking away you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn to find your friend who called you earlier, he seems out of breath. 
		"I got here as fast as I could!" You let him calm down before he could speak again. 
		<br>

		" I don't know if you remember but I - I can send you back if you're willing," Your memory's a blur. 
		You might have remembered something like this. "<i> I </i> can't go back, but I can send <i> you </i> back. 
		Only thing is that if I end you back, you'll feel a little more exhausted and drained than before." Part of you wants to find a way 
to save Haley, but this other part of you feels like you can't do it.
