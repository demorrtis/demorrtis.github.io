<P class=storytext >  You weren't sure if your friend was messing with you, so you try to call her as you head out. But she's not picking up.
	<br>
	 
You didn't look where you were going as you were trying to get in contact and you end up coming across an alley by the main road when you finally noticed where you are. You hear yelling down the road. You recognize this road as a shortcut to Haley's home, but you're real close to her work place.
