<P class=storytext >  You weren't sure if your friend was messing wih you, so you try to call her as you head out. But she's not picking up.
	<br>
You didn't look where you were going as you were frantically calling her. You end up coming across an alley by the main road when you finally noticed where you are. You smell smoke in the air and hear yelling down the road.
	</P>
