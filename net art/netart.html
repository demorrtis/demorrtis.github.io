<P class="storytext" > You  weren't sure if your friend was just messing with you so you try to call her as you head out. But she's not picking up? 
	<br> 
	You didnt look where you were going as you were trying to frantically call her. You end up coming across an alley by the main road when you finallu notice where you are. You hear yelling down the road.
