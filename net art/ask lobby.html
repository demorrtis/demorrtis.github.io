<P class=storytext >  Yuo ask to the person at the register for Haley, but they seem to be confused. They say that she left for home a while ago. As you two were talking, right behind you there's people gathering around the TV. You take a look at what theyre watching. It's breaking news. There's a fire where Haley lives and it looks like the building wont make it. They state that there's been casualties and only a handfull made it out safe and on time.
