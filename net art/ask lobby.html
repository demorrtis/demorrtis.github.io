<P class=storytext >  You ask to the person at the register for Haley, but they seem to be confused. They say that she left for home a while ago. As you two were talking, right behind you there's people gathering around the TV. You take a look at what theyre watching. It's breaking news. There's a fire where Haley lives and it looks like the building wont make it. They state that there's been casualties and only a handfull made it out safe and on time. 
	<br><br>
	As you move to head to the site of the fire, you feel someone grab your shoulder. It's your friend who called you earlier, he seems out of breath. 
		"I got here as fast as I could!" You let him calm down before he could speak again.

		" I don't know if you remember but I - I can send you back if you're willing," Your memory's a blur. 
		You might have remembered something like this. "<i> I </i> can't go back, but I can send <i> you </i> back. 
		Only thing is that if I end you back, you'll feel a little more exhausted and drained than before." Part of you wants to find a way 
to save Haley, but this other part of you feels like you can't do it.
