     <p> I had trouble working with code here, but looking at other examples and their code helps understand what is happening better. <br> 
 For this piece of code, I kept what we were taught in the tutorial, but added more bouncing balls that are effected differently. <br>
 When moving your mouse over the canvas, you have a ball moving with the location of the mouse. When you have your mouse pressed, <br>
 the ball that follows your coordinates starts to flash in colors.
